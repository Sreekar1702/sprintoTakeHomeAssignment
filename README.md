## üîÑ Workflow and Functions

### üõ†Ô∏è Policy Creation and Approval Flow

- A company administrator can create a new policy using either a predefined template or custom content.
- If a template is used, the system creates a `policy` record based on the selected `policy_template`.
- The newly created policy is marked as **"draft"** and awaits approval by a designated approver (e.g., CTO).
- Upon approval, the policy status transitions to **"approved"** and becomes the company's active version.


### üôã Employee Acknowledgement Flow

- When a **new employee** is onboarded, the system automatically triggers **acknowledgement requests** for all active policies with a **30-day** deadline.
- For **periodic acknowledgements** (e.g., annual), the system tracks due dates and sends timely reminders.
- If an employee **misses the acknowledgement deadline**, the system generates an **alert**, escalating it to a CXO or designated authority.
- In case of **modified policies**, only the updated policies are sent for re-acknowledgement.


### üìã Audit and Monitoring

- Every significant action (e.g., policy creation, updates, approvals, acknowledgements) is **logged** in the audit system.
- The system maintains a **complete acknowledgement history** per employee to support compliance audits and traceability.
